Alzheimer's Disease Classification Model:

This repository contains a machine learning model for classifying Alzheimer's disease into four classes: Mild Demented, Very Mild Demented, Non-Demented, and Unknown Demented. The model has been trained with a test accuracy of 99.12%.

Classes:
Mild Demented
Very Mild Demented
Non-Demented
Unknown Demented
Model Details:
The model is based on a state-of-the-art neural network architecture and has been trained on a comprehensive dataset of Alzheimer's disease images. The training process achieved an impressive 99.12% accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its robustness in classifying different stages of Alzheimer's disease.

Usage:
To use the trained model for predicting Alzheimer's disease classes based on an input image, follow these steps:

1) Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2) Run the final.py script to deploy the model using Streamlit. This will start a local server.
streamlit run final.py

3) Access the provided URL in your web browser.
4) Upload an image in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format.
5) The model will predict the Alzheimer's disease class of the given image.

Note:
The model's accuracy is based on the training dataset, and its performance on new, unseen data may vary.

Ensure that the input images are clear and relevant to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis for accurate predictions.
