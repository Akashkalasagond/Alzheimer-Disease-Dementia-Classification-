# Alzheimer Dementia Classification Model

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying Alzheimer's disease into four classes: Mild Demented, Very Mild Demented, Non-Demented, and Unknown Demented. The model, based on a state-of-the-art neural network architecture, achieves a test accuracy of 99.12%.

## Classes

- Mild Demented
- Very Mild Demented
- Non-Demented
- Unknown Demented

## Model Details

The neural network is designed to handle Alzheimer's disease image classification. Trained on a comprehensive dataset, it boasts a remarkable 99.12% accuracy on the test set, showcasing its effectiveness in identifying various stages of Alzheimer's disease.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

5. **Upload an Image:**
    - Upload an image in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format.

6. **Prediction:**
    - The model will predict the Alzheimer's disease class of the given image.

## Note

- The model's accuracy is based on the training dataset, and its performance on new, unseen data may vary.
- Ensure that the input images are clear and relevant to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis for accurate predictions.
